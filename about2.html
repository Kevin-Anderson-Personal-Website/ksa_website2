            <h1>ICE HOCKEY</h1>
            <p>
            I started playing Ice Hockey with my older brother when I was 7 years
            old, in Phoenix, Arizona. Hockey in the desert you ask? Yes, of
            course! Let me ask you this...when it's 115 degrees outside, who
            wouldn't want to hang out in a giant walk-in freezer!?! What started
            as an after school activity to burn some energy turned into a long
            lasting love that continues to the present day. I play on two
            adult-league teams as well as coach youth programs to help grow the
            game and share the thrill I so dearly benefited from.

            <h1>FILMMAKING</h1>
            <p>
            I moved to Los Angeles in 2010 to pursue a career in filmmaking.
            Started out at a camera rental house, networked and did my fair share
            of grinding, and became a freelance camera assistant. After joining
            I.A.T.S.E. Local 600 (International Cinematographers Guild), my career
            and opportunities advanced progressively. I was fortunate enough to
            work on a variety of commercials, feature films, television shows, and
            an academy award winning documentary. I had to make a tough decision
            to gracefully bow out of the industry to focus on my family. It's an
            exciting industry but lacks sustainability, predictability, and is
            almost impossible to find a suitable work-life balance. I'll always
            have a sweet spot in my heart for the filmmaking process!

            <h1>COOKING</h1>
            <p>
            I almost never cooked at home before the Covid-19 pandemic. I loved
            takeout and didn't have any problem ordering out...repeatedly. Until
            that was no longer an option. Out of necessity, I had to learn to cook
            for myself and my wife. In doing so, I found a passion for bringing
            ingredients together, finding a balance, and enjoying the fruits of my
            labor. I specifically enjoy making Neapolitan and Detroit Style
            Pizzas, Smash Burgers, and anything and everything cooked in a Wok. I
            think what I'm getting at is I really like cooking at high
            temperatures!

            <h1>FAMILY</h1>
            <p>
            My wife and I brought our son into the world in April of 2022 and our
            lives were permanently altered. It's been the most difficult, trying,
            and sleepless thing we've ever done but we wouldn't change it for the
            world. Watching my son's eyes light up whenever he sees my wife and I
            means everything to me. Since he came around, my little family has
            become the center of my universe, and I love and appreciate every
            moment shared together as a tribe.
