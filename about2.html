        <h1>ICE HOCKEY</h1>
            <p>I started playing Ice Hockey with my older brother when I was 7 years
                old, in Phoenix, Arizona. Hockey in the desert you ask? Yes, of
                course! Let me ask you this...when it's 115 degrees outside, who
                wouldn't want to hang out in a giant walk in freezer!?! What
                started as an after school activity to burn some energy turned into a
                long lasting love that continues to the present day. I play on two
                adult-league teams as well as coach youth programs to help grow the game
                and share the enjoyment I so dearly benefited from.</p>

        <h1>FILMMAKING</h1>
            <p>I moved to Los Angeles in 2010 to pursue a career in filmmaking. Started out at a camera rental house, networked and did my fair
                share of grinding, and became a freelance camera assistant. After
                joining I.A.T.S.E. Local 600 (International Cinematographers Guild), my
                career and opportunities advanced progressively. I was fortunate
                enough to work on a variety of commercials, feature films, television
                shows, and an academy award winning documentary. I had to make a
                tough decision to gracefully bow out of the industry to focus on my
                family. It's an exciting industry but lacks sustainability,
                predictability, and is almost impossible to find a suitable work-life
                balance. I'll always have a sweet spot in my heart for the
                filmmaking process!</p>

        <h1>COOKING</h1>
            <p>I almost never cooked at home before the Covid-19 pandemic. I
                loved takeout and didn't have any problem ordering out...repeatedly.
                Until that was no longer an option. Out of necessity, I had to
                learn to cook for myself and my wife. In doing so, I found a
                passion for bringing ingredients together, finding a balance, and
                enjoying the fruits of my labor. I specifically enjoy making
                Neapolitan and Detroit Style Pizzas, Smash Burgers, and anything and
                everything cooked in a Wok. I think what I'm getting at is I
                really like cooking at high temperatures!</p>

        <h1>FAMILY</h1>
            <p>My wife and I brought our son into the world in April of 2022 and our
                lives were permanently altered. It's been the most difficult,
                trying, and sleepless thing we've ever done but we wouldn't change it
                for the world. Watching my son's eyes light up whenever he sees my
                wife and I means everything to me. Since he came around, my little
                family has become the center of my universe, and I love and appreciate
                every moment shared together as a tribe.</p>
