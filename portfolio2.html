            <h1>O.J.: MADE IN AMERICA</h1>
            <p>
            Critically acclaimed documentary project I worked on for three years. Shoot days relaxed and mostly consisted of an interview or two and some b-roll. This project has a special place in my heart since it won the biggest accolade for the industry, an Academy Award. Specifically, Best Documentary Feature. Unfortunately, I did not attend the award show but still got to hold the Oscar once the dust settled.

            <p>
            This comedy will always be special to me since I worked on it from its inception and only missed one day over the course of four seasons. I love the cast, crew, and subject matter of this one. I've never worked on a project where the cast actually hung out with the crew after hours. Last season, we held a golf tournament followed by a giant pool party at one of the main cast member's houses. Without a doubt, the most fun project I've ever been a part of.

            <p>
                This was the first project where I was a full-time camera operator. I did an occasional day here or there operating for other projects but for this one it was all day every day and I loved every second of it. The cast was great to work with, the studio lot was closer to home, and the creative freedom the Director of Photography gave me made for a wonderful experience. Happy the show was well received and has another season on deck.
